## Project Notes

Initially, I envisioned a simpler version of the app. However, as time passed, I started implementing new features as my understanding of the core aspects of Twitter evolved. What was supposed to be a 4-month project ended up taking almost 10 months. Due to my initial decision to simplify the app, I opted not to use Redux for state management, a decision I now regret. After implementing multiple components where comments would be rendered (Comments, Replies, Favorites), state management became chaotic and hard to follow. The main goal was to become more acquainted with React, learn Typescript and utilize Firebase for soft entry in the backend side of things and be able to make an easy deployment of a full-stack app.
