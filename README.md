## Project Notes

Initially, I envisioned a simpler version of the app. However, as time passed, I started implementing new features as my understanding of the core aspects of Twitter evolved. What was supposed to be a 4-month project ended up taking almost 10 months. Due to my initial decision to simplify the app, I opted not to use Redux for state management, a decision I now regret. After implementing multiple components where posts would be rendered (Comments, Replies, Favorites etc), state management became chaotic and hard to follow. The main goal of this project was to become more acquainted with React, learn Typescript and utilize Firebase as a soft entry method into the backend side of things and enabling the easy deployment of a full-stack app.
